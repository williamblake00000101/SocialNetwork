Requirements for the project

•	The solution must have a three-layer architecture. The data access layer, business logic, Web application should be moved into separate projects.

•	The interface should be a separate application using HTML, CSS, js technologies + one of the frameworks (Angular)

•	Access to the functionality of the application services should be organized through the web API.

•	Implement differentiation of system users' access rights to application components (at least 2-3 roles).

•	Store information about the subject area in the database, please use Entity Framework Code First for access. Use MS SQL as a DBMS

•	Provide validation of user input.

•	Pay attention to the speed of the project, freezing of the interface when performing data loading, filtering, sorting operations are undesirable;

•	The code should be organized so that it can be reused and relatively easy to replace the implementation of logical parts;

•	Provide error handling!

•	Follow clean code rules - the internal organization and structure of the project code will be assessed no less carefully than the external compliance of the project with the task;

•	Classes and methods must have names that reflect their functionality and must be properly structured in the application (folders, namespaces).

•	Code styling must comply with the C # Code Conventions (MSDN).
